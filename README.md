# Interview Scheduler

Using the latest tools and techniques, I built and tested a React application that allows users to book and cancel interviews. I combined a concise API with a WebSocket server to build a realtime experience. New appointments are made at empty slots, and provide a list of available interviewers for the selected day. Websockets allow users to see real-time updates occur during their session. During development Jest, Storybook, and Cypress were used for integration, isolation, and end-to-end testing.
